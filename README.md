# Moyskladsync

In [Geography](https://vk.com/geo_sarov) craft beer shop we use [Mysklad](https://www.moysklad.ru) to control our stock and purchases. There is a beer directory there with information about OG, ABV, IBU, beer description. However, it's not possible to leave comments or some remarks on this service. It's very important for us to share the feedback.

This script helps us to get rid of this flaw. It downloads all products from Moysklad and uploads them to Google Drive where we can have additionals fields with the feedback. If it's run the second time it will add new items without touching the existing ones.
